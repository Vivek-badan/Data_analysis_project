## Data Cleaning

- **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**: Removed columns `Status` and `unnamed1` as they contained no useful information.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Dropped rows with missing values in the `Amount` column.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converted the `Amount` column to integer type for better analysis.
